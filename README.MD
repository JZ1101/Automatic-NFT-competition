# A Blockchain-Powered Competition source code

### File Structure
This project lets users join a blockchain-based art competition. There are two versions of the competition:
Testing version (12 mins per period): for trying features and viewing past winners.
Final version (7 days per period): Regular use
Each folder (Test_Version and Final_Version) contains its own instructions in a README file.
Source code for smart contracts is located in Contract_Final and Contract_Test within these version directories.

### How to Run
Go to either GUI_Test or GUI_Final folder and start the GUI. Check the README in each folder for more details
